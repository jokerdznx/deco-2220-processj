                <p>Our design brief outlined that we, as interaction designers, must map out the
                  interactions required to assist people in interacting with autonomous vehicles.
                  For us, this meant we needed to find a group of users that might be assisted by
                  autonomous vehicles. A lot of people looked to the immediate connections of autonomous
                  vehicles and passengers of the autonomous vehicles, much like how Uber is rolling out
                  their driverless ride share program. For our group, we decided to focus on an area that
                  people in our studio were not focusing on, mainly to provide a unique solution to the
                  brief. Eventually our group came down to three possible areas: autonomous snow ploughing,
                  working with autonomous military vehicles and lastly, working with autonomous farming vehicles.
                  Eventually, with some input from tutors, we decided on designing for farmers.</p>

                <p>With our research area chosen it was time to start finding out where autonomous technologies would benefit farmers the most. To do this we had to establish our user group and develop user needs based off of research we gathered.</p>
                <p>Initially we decided that farmers would be the obvious user group for our research, however it didn’t take long before we released that there are different types of farmers and that we would need to be more specific in describing our user group.</p>


                <p>We came up with three users that would be potentially using our interactive product: Full time farmers, farmers that farm as a hobby and people that wanted to become farmers.
                </p>
                <p>Establishing our user group with specific users allowed us to start reaching out to farmers and begin developing a survey.

              <h4>Research Methods</h4>
              <p>Interviews and surveys were used to gather research on where our autonomous technology would be best applied on farm. The three of us all found at least one farmer to interview. One of my group members has family in Norway that work on a farm and were able to give us an in-depth view of what a farmer does on a daily basis and where autonomy would be most useful. I reached out to a farmer in Western Australia and was lucky enough to get on the phone with him and ask him questions on how autonomous technology would be best applied to him personally.
              </p>
              <p>With qualitative data gathered from interviews with farmers, we needed numbers and statistics on autonomous technologies on a farm. Our aim was to find out if farmers wanted and/or needed autonomy on a farm. However, we had no idea how to get a hold of enough farmers to gather a large amount of data. Eventually we turned to Reddit. Reddit is an online link sharing website that has pages for almost anything, including a page dedicated to farming, so I made a post explaining our project and linked the survey. Although we didn’t get much responses, it was enough to gain the understanding we needed.
              </p>
              <p>With data collected, we then synthesized our data and developed our user needs. Our user needs were: The product must make farming more efficient for the farmer while reducing physical labour. The product must also allow the farmer to have full control over the vehicle when necessary.

              <div class="col-md-10">
                <p>If I could repeat this phase again I’d definitely try harder to interview more farmers as each interview heavily paved the way for our following concepts. If we had more interviews I believe our final product would have improved tremendously.</p>

                <p>We eventually came up with three concepts.

                <p>We iterated our concepts a couple times over paper then again with wireframes and using Pop to click through the pages on an actual phone, this really helped our users test as it put all the pieces of paper in the context of a phone application.
            We then put users in the environment of a farm and asked them to complete tasks for each concept. This gave us a necessary insight into how users interacted with the app when it wasn’t the main focus for them. This revealed new problems that would have been impossible to find in a controlled environment such as the lounge room of my house. For example, we found that users found it difficult to see the screen in direct sunlight due to the colours we had chosen. This lead us to iterate on the aesthetics of the app and implement a design that both looked pleasing while also being useable outdoors.</p>

                <p>We ended up discontinued the Farm Rover and Surveillance Drone concepts in favour of the autonomous tractor, however, we did implement key ideas that we gathered from our user testing of the discontinued concepts.</p>
                <p>The Farm Rovers main approach was that the user could queue up a list of tasks for the rover to complete on its own throughout the day. Users extremely liked the idea of adding tasks and ordering them around kind of like a playlist of music. Although the concept itself didn’t really line up with our overall user needs, and thus discontinued the concept, we did implement this feature in our final concept.</p>
                <p>Same goes for our Surveillance Drone, the main feature users showed would be best applied on a farm was the fact that they could see everything in real time. However, they really did not like the fact that they would have to have a new vehicle on the farm that they would have to learn to fly and manage, so that concept was later discontinued. Again, the main feature of the drone was actually implemented into the tractor concept, that is, the addition of front and back cameras that would allow users to watch the tractor work in real time.</p>
                <p>In hindsight; the more paper prototypes we could have done, the easier it would have been to fix up things we found in later iterations.</p>

              <p>Starting the development of the app meant that I had to choose a program to work in. In class, we were shown InVision and FramerX. InVIsion was the simpler of the two however you couldn’t do many animations beyond transitions. FramerX on the other hand, you could do whatever you dreamed of if you knew how to code in CoffeeScript, which I wasn’t an expert at. That’s when I found PrincipleForMac, another program that was mentioned by the tutors a couple of times. Principle allowed me to easily navigate and add animations between pages, it actually reminded me a lot of the old Adobe Flash in terms of the animations, you couldn’t edit frame by frame but the linking between pages and key frames was very familiar. Principle asks you to make at least two artboards to animate between, this meant for every page that had an animation, I had to make an extra duplicate of that page. I later found out that you could animate within artboards using drivers but that was a lot more complicated.</p>

                <p>The first iteration of our app looked shocking to say the least, this is partly due to the fact that our wire frames were built in Illustrator and not Sketch. If I could go back in time I would definitely use Sketch as Principle has a built in Sketch plugin.</p>
                <p>As you can see, the final prototype still looked kind of rough and there were many things to fix up, such as the tracking page with the map, the scrolling menu and all the buttons text that were just place holders still.</p>

                <p>Once I got a grip of the way Principle worked, I got a little carried away. With over 1,500 animations and 35 different pages on the final prototype submitted, I think the app looks very pretty and functions just as well.</p>
                <p>It was a big risk going with the hexagon navigation but I believe with the addition of the menu sidebar, it pays off. </p>

              <p>In this walkthroughyou can see some last minor edits made, for example the map page now extends to the full screen, you can hide the hexagons to allow users to see and touch more. Users can also skip to pages via the menu button on the top left, users allow get a preview hexagon of the next page so they dont have to guess where they are going or remember where they were.</p>
              <h6>As a final reflection on the project I believe more time could have been spent in the research of our users and the overall concept ideation could have been less linear than what we went with, by that I mean we could have started with more out of the ordinary ideas just to see what we could get out of them.</h6>
